## Introduction To JavaScript
- We can use Javascript in web development, in front-end to add interactivity,in backend to do identification and server-side related things, etc.
- We need to add the link of javascript file at the end of the body as the flow of code is downwards and it gives a error if we declare the script before any element that is used in the script.

**Syntax** to link a java script file in HTML
<script src="app.js"></script>

Where app.js is a javascript file.
