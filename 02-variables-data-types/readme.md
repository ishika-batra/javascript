## Variables and Data Types in Javascript
 - We declare variables in javascript in the following way.

**OLD WAY**
 var life =100; 

Here, life is a integer type variable whose value is 100.

- We can add comments in javascript by adding //.

**NEW WAY**
const life =100; 

Here, you can't change the value of the variable if you declare it const.

let life=100;

Here, you can change the value of the variable if you declare it let.
